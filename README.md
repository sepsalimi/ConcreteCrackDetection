The majority of the files in segment_anything are from META's package. 

Unfortunately, the notebooks that I've created have to be in this folder to work properly.

The notebooks that are relevant are listed below.

----------------------------------------------


1) Download data folder from: https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1QBIBmfQgNXEU4E7gvOvoSuTKTjYHOWAC?usp=share_link

2) Place download folder under sesgment_anything folder. It should be: "//segment_anything//data/"

3) Open UNET_Model.ipynb for EDA, Wrangling, and Preliminary Training

4) Open UNET_Model_Training&Testing.ipynb for Training and Testing

5) Open Image_Segmentation.ipynb for META's SAM object detection being utlized

6) Open CrackDetection.py for utilizing both META's SAM, and the UNET model I saved. This is not done yet and work in progress.
